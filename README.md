# README
Code repository for reproducing all simulation results and figures in the paper "Penalized Subgrouping of Heterogeneous Time Series" ([Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03085)).

# Overview
The following files are included in this repository:
- `sim_fit.R`: Simulates data and fits all models. Simulated data are stored in `/data` and results of model fitting are stored in `/results`
- `analyze.R`: Calculates summary measures using simulated data and results from `sim_fit.R`. These are saved in `/files/results_all.RDS` and `/files/results_summary.RDS`
- `plots.R`: Creates plots for model recovery and parameter estimate quality metrics. These are saved in `/plots/model_recovery.pdf` and `/plots/param_quality.pdf`
- `calculate_measures.R`: Function used by `analyze.R` for computing model recovery and parameter estimate metrics
- `/files`: Stores simulation results calculated by `analyze.R` as `.RDS`
- `/plots`: Stores plots generated by `plots.R`
- `/data`: Empty folder that will store simulated data generated by `sim_fit.R` as `.RDS`. See below for access to already simulated data
- `/results`: Empty folder that will store results from model-fitting procedures generated by `sim_fit.R` as `.RDS`. See below for access to already computed results

# Data and Results Access
Simulating data and fitting all models is computationally intensive, so the original study was conducted using a high performance computing cluster. These data and results can be obtained at the following public repository: XXX. These can be downloaded and stored in `/data` and `/results`, respectively, and can then be used with `analyze.R` and `plots.R`.
